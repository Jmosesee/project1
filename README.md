# I thought the project here:
# https://github.com/jobapis/jobs-authenticjobs
# looked promising at first, but now looking closer, it seems to be PHP, not python, so I don't know what good that will do for us.
# So I'm just working with
# https://authenticjobs.com/api/
# Please try to obey the rules so we don't get blocked:
