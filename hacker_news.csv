Quickly-growing companies can spend a significant fraction of their engineers&#x27; time interviewing; we help take the load off. We&#x27;ve done a lot to make the interview experience better for all stakeholders that I could write whole essays about, but suffice it to say that candidates love working with us, clients love working with us, and we&#x27;re well-funded and growing quickly as a result.<p>Because of this quickly-growing demand, we&#x27;re looking to hire more Expert Interviewers. The ideal candidate is a software engineer with strong written and verbal English skills with at least a few years of professional experience. Interviewing experience would be great, but we spend 25 hours (paid) training you before you even start, so if you&#x27;re strong technically and love working with people we can usually make it work :) Interviews are conducted over video chat, using a collaborative code editor.<p>Some of our interviewers are freelancers who use our scheduling model to backfill hours; others are full timers at top tech companies looking to make some extra cash; others have quit their jobs to work with us full time; some are digital nomads; one of our interviewers is road tripping around North America for a year and a half, doing anywhere from zero to 40 interviews each week depending on where he is and what the weather&#x27;s like.<p>The application form is here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced64c86?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source=HNWH"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced6...</a><p>I know it&#x27;s a pretty unique job, so if you have any questions reply here or email me at josh@karat.io and I&#x27;m happy to talk through any of it.<p>P.S.

having your day ruined by functional QA testers who find every bug you write,
carrying out and being on the receiving end of intense code review sessions from your peers who hold your work (and their own) at the highest of standards,
agonizing over the user experience until even a trained monkey could use the product,
collaborating with and mentoring your peers on security best practices,

Hacker News,"Expensify - Portland, OR, San Francisco, CA - Full Stack Engineer, Mobile Engineer, Infrastructure Engineer<p>Hey there! Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do “expense reports that don’t suck!” (Google “expensify” to read more.) We’re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren’s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it’s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won’t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn’t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We’ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and Uruguay. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We’re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you’re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you’re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out.<p>If you’re this sort of person, you’ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn’t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That’s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it’s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I’m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don’t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com</a>) or email us at jobs@expensify.com.

Hacker News,"I see you have nearly 30 different third-party frameworks in your iOS app, some of which are purely for user-tracking and analytics purposes. Furthermore, it looks like you’re using AWS (AWS Rekognition) and Azure (Microsoft Face API) AI&#x2F;Image&#x2F;Face recognition services. Although your Privacy Policy mostly covers what you’re doing, a more prominent permission request screen and more explicit warnings about this is warranted. Your iOS app is basically just a shell really. All of its functionality is provided by cloud services. Although this is the norm nowadays, I think the burden of informing the users falls primarily on you, the developer, especially considering the main subject of your app is infants and children. All of this is further alarming since your app isn’t free so even the Facebook excuse of “it’s free!” doesn’t really apply here."

Hacker News,"Academia.edu | Full Stack Engineer | San Francisco, CA | Onsite
Academia.edu is addressing two problems:<p>- Open access. The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.<p>- Robustness. The goal here is to produce a set of signals around any given academic paper that indicate how robust the paper’s claims and findings are.<p>It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the academic literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as &quot;the reproducibility crisis”. Peer review is not a robustness filter; we need a separate filter to indicate robustness.<p>With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 19 million pdfs to Academia.edu. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to robustness, we think the way to build a robustness layer on top of papers is a) to mine the existing graph of citations for commentary and (b) crowd-source commentary&#x2F;peer review from the academic community.<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (b), and a citation graph infrastructure that is the basis of our approach to (a). We believe that addressing robustness is a challenge and an opportunity. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us.<p>We have raised $33 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. The company is profitable off a premium subscription model. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes &quot;We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world.&quot;<p>We are looking to hire full stack software engineers.

If so, you may fit in well with our mindset.<p>The work will include: Doing direct integrations with banks that offer good APIs. Expanding our API for other systems to integrate with us. Adding new features. Optimising for performance. Integrating with government systems. Squashing bugs. Eventually, the opportunity to do some mobile development (probably using Flutter).<p>Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they&#x27;ve learnt.<p>Location: Most of the team is in GMT+2, and I&#x27;ll be in GMT+8 going forward.

Expert Interviewer at Karat (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;karat.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;karat.io</a>)<p>Work from anywhere in the world that has a solid internet connection. Work as much or as little as you want. Work any day, any time of day, any number of hours -- you can do 0 one week, 50 the next week, and back to 0 the next week. Only requirement there is that we want you to roughly average at least 10 hours a week, or else the training&#x2F;time investment doesn&#x27;t make as much sense from your end or ours. When each interview is done, you&#x27;re done.<p>I know the above might sound a little strange, so a bit about the company for context: Karat is a Seattle-based startup that does software engineering interviews on behalf of other companies -- primarily first-round phone screens. Quickly-growing companies can spend a significant fraction of their engineers&#x27; time interviewing; we help take the load off. We&#x27;ve done a lot to make the interview experience better for all stakeholders that I could write whole essays about, but suffice it to say that candidates love working with us, clients love working with us, and we&#x27;re well-funded and growing quickly as a result.<p>Because of this quickly-growing demand, we&#x27;re looking to hire more Expert Interviewers. The ideal candidate is a software engineer with strong written and verbal English skills with at least a few years of professional experience. Interviewing experience would be great, but we spend 25 hours (paid) training you before you even start, so if you&#x27;re strong technically and love working with people we can usually make it work :) Interviews are conducted over video chat, using a collaborative code editor.<p>Some of our interviewers are freelancers who use our scheduling model to backfill hours; others are full timers at top tech companies looking to make some extra cash; others have quit their jobs to work with us full time; some are digital nomads; one of our interviewers is road tripping around North America for a year and a half, doing anywhere from zero to 40 interviews each week depending on where he is and what the weather&#x27;s like.<p>The application form is here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced64c86?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source=HNWH"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;karat&#x2F;d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced6...</a><p>I know it&#x27;s a pretty unique job, so if you have any questions reply here or email me at josh@karat.io and I&#x27;m happy to talk through any of it."

Hacker News,"Academia.edu | Full Stack Engineer | San Francisco, CA | Onsite<p>Academia.edu is addressing two problems:<p>- Open access. The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.<p>- Robustness. The goal here is to produce a set of signals around any given academic paper that indicate how robust the paper’s claims and findings are.<p>It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the academic literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as &quot;the reproducibility crisis”. Peer review is not a robustness filter; we need a separate filter to indicate robustness.<p>With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 19 million pdfs to Academia.edu. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.<p>With regard to robustness, we think the way to build a robustness layer on top of papers is a) to mine the existing graph of citations for commentary and (b) crowd-source commentary&#x2F;peer review from the academic community.<p>Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (b), and a citation graph infrastructure that is the basis of our approach to (a).

You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]<p>In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time.

Hacker News,"Expensify - Portland, OR, San Francisco, CA - Full Stack Engineer, Infrastructure Engineer<p>Hey there! Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do “expense reports that don’t suck!” (Google “expensify” to read more.) We’re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren’s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it’s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won’t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn’t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We’ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and Uruguay. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We’re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you’re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you’re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you’re this sort of person, you’ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn’t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That’s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it’s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I’m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don’t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com</a>) or email us at jobs@expensify.com.

Hacker News,"Expensify - Portland, OR, San Francisco, CA - Full Stack Engineer, Infrastructure Engineer<p>Hey there! Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do “expense reports that don’t suck!” (Google “expensify” to read more.) We’re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren’s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it’s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won’t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn’t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We’ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and Uruguay. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We’re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing&#x2F;designing&#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you’re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you’re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out.<p>If you’re this sort of person, you’ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn’t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That’s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it’s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I’m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don’t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;we.are.expensify.com</a>) or email us at jobs@expensify.com.

* Our customers include great brands such as: Kevin Hart, Peloton, FanDuel, Drake, Lyft &amp; more.<p>Technical Stack<p>* Our tech stack is Rails 4, Webpack, React, Postgres, Heroku. 
* Looking for 3+ years experience in running production systems, ability to iterate quickly and sense of ownership. 
* Strong focus on user experience and putting the customer first.<p>Technical Challenges<p>* We have a complex frontend user interface. Users should be able to view 100,000+ markers and transit lines on a map without their browser crawling to a halt. We need to support complex and interesting map visualizations – layering political voting data, Census data, Foursquare data and more.<p>* We&#x27;re a search company. AdQuick conducts a search every time the user pans the map. Searching by geography, demographics, AdQuick score and a myriad of other attributes from disparate data sources is computationally expensive. It will be a challenge to scale while keeping search response times and server costs low.<p>* We&#x27;re a data science company. We integrate with Google Analytics &amp; AdWords and other data sources to measure impact of physical advertising on online behavior (CTR in a region). ROI data from prior campaigns can help create more effective future campaigns. As our data warehouse grows, crunching this data will be increasingly challenging and more powerful. We&#x27;ll use machine learning to create better campaigns overtime.<p>* Our backend systems have to deal with a myriad of inventory CSV, PDF formats, requiring robust and fast file validations, normalization and ingestion systems.<p>* We scraped Instagram and used image recognition to see if people shared photos of billboards. Turns out, a lot of people Instagram&#x27;d Drake&#x27;s board. Innovative ROI tools are a core part of our offering."

Hacker News,"Clever (YC S12) - San Francisco - onsite 
Right now the market for educational software is a mess. It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale. School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing. Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.
At Clever, we’re working to change all that. We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze. We’ve grown fast: after five years, half of all schools in the US (68,000 schools) are using our platform. Our goals are much bigger than that, though. We want to be two things:<p>-a single place where schools can easily integrate, manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and<p>-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of about 115 (40 engineers) based in downtown SF, and we’re looking for engineers who enjoy working in (or would enjoy learning) Golang, Node and React. More generally, we want people who are sharp, adaptable, and passionate about improving the way education works for everyone.<p>Check us out at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clever.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;jobs</a> !"

The field of automated parsing has been bogged down for the last 20 years because of its dependence on labelled training data (e.g the Penn Treebank).

Hacker News,"PolyAI | London&#x2F;Singapore | Onsite&#x2F;Remote<p>PolyAI is building the backend machinery to allow computers to have two-way conversations with people. If you&#x27;ve used Siri, you&#x27;ll probably know that it&#x27;s okay at handling single-sentence commands like &quot;remind me to call Jane in 2 hours&quot;, but anything significantly more complicated - anything that requires a 2-way conversation to establish what you want - is much much more flakey and inconvenient. At PolyAI, we&#x27;re building the first developer platform for making scalable, maintainable voice apps that rely on <i>conversations</i>, rather than just single-commands.

  - Knowing your way around PostgreSQL, or failing that any large scale RDBMS deployment; there are infrastructure teams and DBAs but they need your guidance.

  - At least some enjoyment of the resolution of large, complex problems using more abstract methods as opposed to quick hacks and duct tape.
