AdvicePay is the missing puzzle piece to bring real financial planning to all Americans. Historically financial planning advice was only available to millionaires; however advisors have shifted focus to helping people build wealth, instead of only those who already have wealth. Financial advisors have complicated compliance regulations that have hindered the ability for them to work with all clients. </span></p>\\n<p style=\\\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">&nbsp;</p>\\n<p style=\\\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\"><span style=\\\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\\\">About the Position</span></p>\\n<p style=\\\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\"><span style=\\\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\\\">This is a full-time position for a Senior UI/UX Designer. The senior designer will be responsible for making our SaaS application user-friendly and b-e-a-utiful for the advisors and their clients who use AdvicePay. You will be the first on-staff UI/UX designer; this requires you to have the ability to understand, create and lead the user experience of the platform along with the overall design direction. This position requires autonomy and independence, so the ability to make decisions and self-manage is key. You will also work alongside various AdvicePay stakeholders, such as the product manager, CEO, lead developer, and our Happiness Hero to gather and evaluate product requirements and deliver experience that meet the needs of both the Advisors and their clients.</span></p>\\n<p style=\\\"line-height: 1.38;

From her vision arose the Whitney Museum of American Art, which has been championing the most innovative art of the United States for 86 years. The core of the Whitney&rsquo;s mission is to collect, preserve, interpret, and exhibit American art of our time and serve a wide variety of audiences in celebration of the complexity and diversity of art and culture in the United States. Through this mission and a steadfast commitment to artists themselves, the Whitney has long been a powerful force in support of modern and contemporary art and continues to help define what is innovative and influential in American art today. </span></em></p>\\n<p><em><span style=\\\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: 'MS Mincho'; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;\\\">The Whitney Museum of American Art is an Equal Opportunity Employer.
